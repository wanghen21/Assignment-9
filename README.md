## Surfs UP
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. Once we run our queries we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the .describe() method. Here is what we found:

June

Based on the data, it shows, comparing month of June and December, the average temperature does not fluctuate as much. The average/mean dropped no more than 4 degrees from June to December. Without data showing other climatic attributes, the temperature is pretty stable from June to December; which makes it ideal to open a surf shop.
